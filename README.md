## About

Competitive programming is all about solving algorithmic problems efficiently. Python, while not always the fastest, is a highly versatile and beginner-friendly language that makes problem-solving fun and accessible.

This repository serves as a guide and a resource bank for competitive programmers using Python. It includes:

- Solutions to problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, **HackerRank**, and more.
- Tutorials on Python tricks and optimizations.
- Implementations of common algorithms and data structures.

## Why Python for Competitive Programming?

Python is a great choice for competitive programming because:

1. **Ease of Use**: Its syntax is concise and readable, helping you focus on the algorithm.
2. **Rich Libraries**: Libraries like `collections`, `math`, and `itertools` simplify complex tasks.
3. **Community Support**: A large community ensures a wealth of resources for learning and troubleshooting.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Python can be slower for very large inputs due to its interpreted nature. Use it for contests with moderate constraints or switch to PyPy for better performance.
